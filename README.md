# array-class
Lightweight php package to work with arrays like in JavaScript. Collections-like.

You can find some similar projects or libraries but they often wrap a in-built function within class with methods. 
They are also weak typed or they don't have tests or docs etc. My project was built having in mind, that this library have to be:
* lightweight
* fast 
* operating a object like a array (class has only one field, length)
* full tested
* strict typed for better security
* has docs
* be like JavaScript array object

## Not implemented/ Work in progress
* some methods
* docs 
* homepage
